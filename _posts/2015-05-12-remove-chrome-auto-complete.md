title: Remove Auto-complete Entries in Google Chrome

Whenever I fail to write a URL correctly in Google Chrome the auto-complete will punish me for a long time. Today I've learned how to remove entries from the auto-completion list.

## Linux & Windows

Just highlight the entry you wont to remove in the drop-down list (using the arrow keys, or your mouse cursor) and press <kbd>delete</kbd> on your keyboard.

## Mac

For macOS users this is a little more tricky. First start by typing the unwanted auto-completed URL until it shows itself.  

Then hit <kbd>fn</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>delete</kbd> if you have a compact keyboard or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>delete</kbd>  if you have a keyboard with separate <kbd>delete</kbd> key (and no <kbd>fn</kbd>).  If you have a non-Apple keyboard, <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>delete</kbd> should do the trick.

In my case, I had accidentally written `http://packagist.com`, which didn't exist before. It bugged me for days and today I finally found a solution. Thanks for reading along!
